# KODI-DLIVE.plugin

Welcome to my DLIVE addon for KODI

I hope you get some use out of it. Feel free to feedback any suggestions and/or code improvements.


Instructions:

* Install the add-on
* Set your DLIVE user name. You can get this from the DLIVE website. Open the settings for your account. DO NOT use the Display Name.

By default the username is set to winsomehax (my account). The addon accesses the DLIVE site to get the list of streamers you follow.

NOTE: This isn't a security issue/problem. You can see who other users are following via the DLIVE website.

Open the addon and it will show a top level menu:

1) Live streams by followed users
2) Archived streams by followed users for replay

Option 1 will list all the live streams running by the users you are following.
Option 2 will list all the DLIVE users you are following. Selecting a user will then list all of their archived streams.

Once you have a list of streams, select one and... enjoy watching.

Disclaimer

It's yours. If you break it, you can keep the pieces. If you want to add stuff feel free. You just need to follow the GPL and make your improvements available to others.
